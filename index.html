	<h1>Java Cohort 7</h1>
	<p>Hey guys, welcome to the very basic Java Cohort 7 website. I'm hoping this will be a good medium for us to share ideas, organize groups, and ultimately, build our coding skills. My though it that we work on this site together, to build different pages, impliment apps, and more!</p>
	<p>I'm thinking that we could all take on the task of building different pages for this site. Things like contact pages, reading pages, etc. If anyone has other ideas this is the place to voice them. I'm new to this but <a href="https://bitbucket.org/javacohort7/html-css-and-beyond">here</a> is the BitBucket Repository for the site, shoot me an email ekaranou@kent.edu and I can get you access to this repository so we all can upload different sites that I can link to this page</p>
	<h3>How to clone this repository onto your very own machine!</h3>
	<p>So there are some nice software tools that will do this for you, but we're programers, we do this from the command line. First, send me a message with your email so I can add you to the repo. Then, using terminal create a folder for the site, and move to that folder in terminal. The you'll use the command<br><br>git clone https://ekaranou@bitbucket.org/javacohort7/html-css-and-beyond.git<br><br>Again this will only work if you've been granted access to the repo. Then you can follow the same steps we use to pull down the exercises each day to get, change, and modify files.</p>
	<p>Note: this does not upload the files to the actual site, I've got to do that manually. However I hope to be able to get this setup so that we can all upload files to the domain.</p>
